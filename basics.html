			<h3>The types of modding</h3>
			Modding in Warframe can be split up into two major types: Warframe modding and Weapon modding. These two types of modding can be split up further. Warframe modding can be split up into the roles it plays, support, DPS, crowd control, and tank. Weapons are (almost) always DPS, but can be split up into crit, status, and raw damage builds, though the last one is rarely used.

			Two of the key things to remember in modding anything in warframe are mod level and capacity. Each warframe or weapon has a maximum mod capacity, and a number of mod slots. The capacity can be increased by ranking up your warframe, and also applying orokin reactors or catalysts, known by the community as potatos. Mods take up a specific amount of capacity and one slot. The capscity is specific to the mod, and if the mod is placed in a matching polarity slot, then its capacity cost is halved. Mod level increases a mod's effectiveness, but also its capacity cost. However, you still want to use the highest level mods you can.
